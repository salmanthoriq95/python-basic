## 01 - Variable and Data Types

So this is the basic of variables and data types in python. There is several data types that available in python like other programming language, but also there is data types that only available in python.

In this branch also we learn how to assign value to variable, casting or change to other data type, print the variables, get input from console or terminal, show the data type of variable, and create constanta.

Hope it's not only for my documentation but it can help you when you forget something about variable and data type, thank you.
